# Light-the-Way

The city of Boston can be a dangerous place to walk home alone at night; whether you are a college student coming home from the library or just someone walking home late from visting a friends, it can be scary walking by yourself in the dark. Light the Way utilizes a dataset of streetlights in Boston and finds the most well-lit route from one location to another using the MapBox API.
